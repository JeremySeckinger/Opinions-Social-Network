## Description

## Technologies used

This bomb-ass app was made with Node.js, MongoDB, vanilla JavaScript, EJS, and TailwindCSS. _Node way_, are we right?

- [ ] Add a hover over opinion to see a mini window of more posts created by user & be able to click to their profile
- [ ] Enable users to update their opinions
- [x] Add a downvote button 
- [ ] Make photograph upload optional
