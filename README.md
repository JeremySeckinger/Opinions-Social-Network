### Have you ever wanted to state your opinion and then have like no one be able to counter it? My friend, this app is for YOU. This is your time to shine. 


## Description

On Opinion, you can create an account, share your opinions, and look at the opinions of others. While you can't counter their opinions directly, you can give them a like if you are feeling that sweet sweet reinforcement of your own beliefs--or downvote them to eternity, up to you ðŸ˜ˆ
