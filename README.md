### Have you ever wanted to state your opinion and then have like no one be able to counter it? My friend, this app is for YOU. This is your time to shine. 

### On Opinion, you can create an account, share your opinions, and look at the opinions of others. While you can't counter their opinions directly, you can give them a like if you are feeling that sweet sweet reinforcement of your own beliefs. 

### This bomb-ass app was made with Node.js, MongoDB, vanilla JavaScript, EJS, and TailwindCSS. _Node way_, are we right?

### You may be wondering, "Do I need any fancy stuff to run this incredible app?" And the answer to that, our friend, would be, "Nope. U good." Just put in that URL and smash that enter button. 
### "What about installing anything?" Again, u good homie. It's just like a regular website. 

## What are some sick things we've done in Opinion?

### While we are flattered, you fabulous user, we humbly submit that yes, there is more that we could do. In the future, we hope to:
- [] Add usernames attached to opinions
- [] Create a public user profile page to see created opinions and amount of upvotes
- [] Add a hover over opinion to see a mini window of more posts created by user & be able to click to their profile
- [] Enable users to update their opinions
- [] Add a downvote button 

### The team members that made this sick app come to life are [Jeremy Seckinger](https://github.com/JeremySeckinger), [Shara Crosslin](https://github.com/citizen-snipz), [Tim Calas](https://github.com/tinytorches), [Jonathan Yau](https://github.com/Jonathankyau), [Marcelo Azevedo](https://github.com/celoazevedo), and [Ruth Reed](https://github.com/helloitsrufio).
